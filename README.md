Credit Card Transaction Report
Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card transactions to identify key spending trends and patterns using Power BI for data visualization. The project also integrates data from a MySQL database, with the data initially loaded from a CSV file, and utilizes DAX for creating calculated columns and measures to enhance insights.

Key Features

Data Import:
Loaded transaction data from a CSV file into a MySQL database.
Imported the data from MySQL to Power BI for analysis.

Data Transformation:
Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI to create new calculated columns and measures for deeper insights.

Visualizations:
Created interactive dashboards and reports to visualize transaction patterns, spending categories, and customer behavior.
Utilized various chart types (bar charts, pie charts, line charts) to present data in an engaging and clear manner.

Tools & Technologies Used :
MySQL: For storing and managing transaction data.
Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and performing data analysis.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns and measures.
CSV File: Used as the initial data source.

Insights Gained:
Identified the highest spending categories and transaction trends over time.
Analyzed customer behavior, including frequency and timing of transactions.
Generated actionable insights to optimize credit card usage and spending strategies.

Future Improvements:
Adding predictive analysis for future spending trends.
Implementing a time-based comparison for transactions year-over-year.
Enhancing the report with machine learning insights.

Acknowledgments:
Guided by the tutorials of Rishab Mishra, whose insights were crucial in completing this project.
